This App was made to support deploying CS packages by Vasilii Mikhailov, vami473@gmail.com

There are two dashboards:
1. CS Results Prediction - to help predict results of CS.
	1.1 All searches are stored in the lookup cs_pred_lp.csv. If you want to change/add any search add them there.
	1.2 All lookups have prefix "csapp_" to avoid name duplicates.
	1.3 This app doesnt include Windows DM!

2. CS Status Check - to help check how CS are running and executing.
